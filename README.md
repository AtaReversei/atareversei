### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

âš› Iâ€™m currently fiddling with React. `ctrl+alt+t` and then `npm i create-react-app`. see? I know some React too.  
ğŸ”µ In the meantime, I am also exploring golang, databases, and doing simple backendish stuff. (and yes in case you are curious, that blue thing is the gopher.)
